# lid (Lily's ID)

MSRV: 1.60.0

I wanted something that I could trust with being unique enough, while also being extremely fast and light on system
resources.

My initial usecase for this was an ID that was unique and could be generated by multiple services without worry, I
didn't need it to be unguessable, though you can configure it to fit a need where you don't want people guessing IDs.

By default, this uses the Base36 Alphabet with 16 prefix bytes and 12 sequence bytes. This gives (36^28) possible IDs.

# Example usage

```rust
use lid::configs::{new_distributed, new_random};

fn main() {
    // `new_distributed` gives a low randomness LID instance with the default size of 20 bytes.
    // Don't use it if you don't want people potentially guessing next IDs.
    let mut lid = new_distributed();
    println!("{}", lid.generate());

    // `new_random` gives a high randomness LID instance.
    // Generic parameters are prefix and sequence length, combined is the total size of the id.
    let mut lid = new_random::<6, 6>();
    println!("{}", lid.generate());

    // This uses static Mutex backed instances of the generators above.
    // You must enable the `easy` feature to use these.
    println!("{}", lid::easy::generate_distributed());
    println!("{}", lid::easy::generate_random());
}

```
